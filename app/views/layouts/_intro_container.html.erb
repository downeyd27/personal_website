    <p>
      Hi, my name is <span itemprop="name" translate="no" >Dillon </span>
      <span itemprop="familyName" translate="no">Downey</span>.
      I am currently enjoying life in the beautiful Portland, Oregon area where my lovely wife and I decided to dive head first into our careers as web developers.  Prior to changing careers, I worked in customer service as a
      <span translate="no">GNC (General Nutrition Center)</span> Senior Store Manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoyed my customer service work, but saw a career on my feet undesirable after hurting my back. While on my back, I took the opportunity to build on previous interest of becoming a
      <span itemprop="JobTitle">junior web developer</span> by completing three online web development courses through the local community college.  This led me to
      <span itemprop="alumniof" translate="no">Dev BootCamp</span> in San Francisco where I emerged myself in their 19 week curriculum of emotional empathy training, yoga, Ruby on Rails, JavaScript and jQuery
    </p>
    <p>
      With my new found passion for programming, I find myself obsessing over clean looking resuable code, user experience, and web performance.  I am continually looking for new technologies and best practices to further my journey to becoming an expert at my craft.  If you would like to drop me a line, I always appreciate actionable, specific, and kind <%= mail_to "downeydillon@gmail.com", "feedback", subject: "Feedback on dillondowney.herokuapp.com" %>.
